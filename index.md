# The Nobis Lab

Our lab uses cutting edge techniques to take a neural circuit approach to study epilepsy, in particular seizure-related respiratory dysfunction and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Our goal is harness this knowledge to develop strategies to prevent SUDEP and treat epilepsy and its commorbidities. Toward this goal, we use a variety of approaches including electrophysiology, imaging, optogenetics, plethysmography, fiber photometry, calcium imaging, EEG and telemetry.

  text="Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder that encompasses more than simply repeated seizures and requires a multidisciplinary approach to make scientific advances. Our hope is that combining multiple research techniques can make headway to inform new therapeutic approaches for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy prevention and the treatment of epilepsy and its comorbidities, as well as other neurologic disease with shared pathophysiology such as sudden unexpected infant death and respiratory depression."

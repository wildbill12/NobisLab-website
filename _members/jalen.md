Jalen is originally from Huntington, West Virginia. She graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Neuroscience, where she completed a project on the neural mechanisms that connect opioid use disorder to mood variability and relapse vulnerability. She is now a graduate student in the Biomedical Sciences Masters program at Vanderbilt, where she is continuing her passion for neuroscience in the Nobis Lab! Outside of the lab, she loves finding new places in Nashville, from workout studios to restaurants. She is the dog advocate in a very pro-cat lab—Vinny (left) and Jax (right) are very much in support of more dog representation. :)

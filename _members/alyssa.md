Alyssa is from South Boston, VA and graduated with a BS in Neuroscience from William & Mary. Her interests in the lab and science include neural circuitry,
translating science from the lab to medicine and working with the students through their undergraduate and graduate school journeys. She loves her cat Habanero 
(pictured), learning fun facts/trivia and the Kansas City Chiefs!

She left us to pursue law school back at William & Mary.

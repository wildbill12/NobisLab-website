Sarah completed her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from University of Minnesota in 2024 investigating the neurobiological mechanisms of alcohol and nicotine addiction. She is from Nashville and completed her undergraduate BS Biology and BA Latin degree from Wake Forest University in 2018. She is broadly interested in neural circuit modulation, and has research experience in behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular neuroscience.
When Sarah is not in the lab, she enjoys playing video games and table roleplaying games, learning Brazilian jiu jitsu, crafting and painting, and spending time with her cat Violet (pictured).

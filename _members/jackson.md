Jackson graduated from Kansas State University in 2021, where he worked in Dr. Charles Pickens’s behavioral neuroscience lab studying the effects of adolescent drug exposure on operant behavior in adulthood. Next, he went to UNC-Chapel Hill to work in Dr. Zoe McElligott’s lab where he continued studying the neurobiology of substance use disorders, namely opioid- and alcohol-use disorders.
Now, as a graduate student in the Nobis lab, Jackson is excited to expand his skillset and further develop as a scientist while studying the neural circuitry of epilepsy and SUDEP.

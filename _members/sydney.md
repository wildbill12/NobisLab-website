I am from central jersey and graduated from Penn State University with a B.S. degree in Biology/Neuroscience as a member of Cohort 6 of the Millennium Scholars Program. I am interested in studying the effects of Fenfluramine on BNST activity and ultimately work to uncover the underlying causes of SUDEP and seizure induced respiratory dysfunction. I love gymnastics, video gaming and my fur child Appa!

Sydney finished a masters in Neuroscience, and is hoping to continue to pursue a career in epilepsy.
